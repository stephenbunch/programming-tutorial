# Strategy

Based on [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).

1. **Identify** - Ability to recognize the elements (fundamentals) of the discipline.
2. **Hack** - Understand cause and effect. Tweak components to change behavior by adding, removing, and replacing elements.
3. **Synthesis** - Put elements together to create new components.
4. **Create** - Create new elements. Build new theories of understanding.

## Programming
1. **Identify** - Learn about values, variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and procedures. Be able to identify them in a program.
2. **Hack** - Learn how the structure of the elements cause a particular program output. Get comfortable changing values, tweaking conditional statements, and adding new procedures to change the output.
3. **Synthesis** - Build a program from scratch to achieve a certain output.

## Music
1. **Identify** - Learn about scales, key signatures, rythm, chords, cadence and syncopation. Be able to identify them in a song.
2. **Hack** - Learn how songs create feeling and set moods. Tweak songs to change the resulting feeling.
3. **Synthesis** - Compose a new song by combining different elements.

## History
1. **Identify** - Learn about the different time periods and key events.
2. **Hack** - Learn how one time period led to the next. Tweak key events in the past to change the present.
3. **Synthesis** - Use past and current events to paint the future.
